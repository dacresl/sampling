# Assignment: Questionnaire Design and Sample Evaluation

## Requirements

The goal of this assignment is to practice developing and evaluating sampling materials.

### Part A - Survey Design:

Select one of the scenarios below and design a survey to meet the need(s) outlined in the prompt.

1.	In two to three sentences, describe the purpose of your survey
2.	Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and overall sampling strategy.
3.	Write a 5-10 question survey to address your chosen scenario below.

##### Scenarios
1.	You work in the Human Resources Department at a large tech company. Over the past few months, the company has been experiencing a high turnover rate across many of its departments, specifically within the entry- and lower-level positions. The company wishes to understand why this turnover is happening, and what changes need to occur to improve employee satisfaction.
2.	You work for a Canadian national political party during a federal election. Throughout the campaign period, your party has seen relatively high approval ratings, but an opposing party is also polling favorably and may still have a chance to win the election. You are one month away from the election and you want to understand what voters want from your party and its leader in order to maintain your lead and eventually win the election.
3.	You are a student researcher in the sociology department at the University of Toronto. You are working on a research project that concerns the relationship between music taste and age. This involves both comparisons between different people of different ages and comparisons of the same individual at different ages during their lifetime. You wish to understand to what extent age influences music taste, specifically as it relates to perceptions of popular music. Your results will be written into an academic paper that you hope to publish.

### Part B - Survey Evaluation:

For the **Canadian General Social Survey on Giving, Volunteering, and Participating, 2018 (cycle 33)**, conducted by Statistics Canada find any and all available documentation for the data gathered and identify and describe the survey features indicated below.

1. Sample type
2. Sample size
3. Target population
4. Sampling frame
5. Survey mode(s) 
6. Timeline
7. Response rate
8. Weights
9. Data processing
10. Cleaning, imputation, etc
11. Sources of error
12. Limitations, known biases, etc
13. Link to documentation and any additional sources used


# Your Changes

## Part A - Survey Design: 

The number of your chosen topic: #1

Describe the purpose of your survey:

write your answer here...

The survey aims to gather information related to a variety of factors in the workplace that could be contributing to the high turn-over rate. The purpose of the survey is to identify the main factors that are contributing to indeterminate employees in entry and lower-level positions to leaving the company at high rates. 

Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and observational units:

## Part B - Survey Evaluation:

Identify and describe survey features:
```
write your answer here
1. Sample type - Stratified sampling. A simple random sample without replacement of records was next selected in each stratum. Rejective sampling was also used.

2. Sample size - The target sample size was 20,000 but the actual sample size was 16,149 people.

3. Target population - Persons aged 15 years and over living in private households in Canada, excluding residents of the Yukon, Northwest Territories and Nunavut and full time residents of institutions. 

4. Sampling frame - Data from sources of telephone numbers in use (landline and cellular) available to Statistics Canada and the Address Register (AR): List of all swellings within the ten provinces. The Address Register (AR) was used to group together all telephone numbers associated with the same valid address. About 86% of available telephone numbers were linked to the AR. The records resulting from this linkage could possess more than one telephone number (grouped by the address). The other 14% of telephone numbers not linked to the AR were also included on the frame9. The combination of those two components resulted in the survey frame.

5. Survey mode(s) - Telephonic and and internet questionnaire (with invitation letter sent in the mail)

6. Timeline - 12 months preceding the interview. Interviews were conducted from September 4th to December 28th, 2018.

7. Response rate - 41.9%

8. Weights - Household weight, non-rsponding households, person weight (adjusted several times using a raking ratio procedure), startum adjustment, income adjustment, province-age-sex adjustment. The weight produced at the end of these steps is the final person weight WGHT_PER.

9. Data processing - Data capture, coding, verification was performed to identify and eliminate potential duplicate records and to drop non-response and out-of-scope records, imputation, derived variables. 

10. Cleaning, imputation, etc - For item and partial non-response, donor imputation was done for certain variables. Where donor imputation could not be used, mean imputation among a pool of donors was used. Imputation was carried out in nine steps. 
1) imputing personal income and family income.
2-4) imputing the formal volunteering variables in the analytical master file. 
5-6) imputing the informal volunteering variables in the analytical master file. 
7-9) imputing variables in the donation file and the solicitation methods (FG1A_030 to FG1A_140 and FG1A_170) in the analytical master file.

11. Sources of error - Total non-response, item  and partial non-responses, missing information, user error.

12. Limitations, known biases, etc - Excluded residents of the territories and institutions. There were significant differences in sampling fractions between strata. Thus, some areas were over-represented in the sample (relative to their populations) while some other areas were relatively under-represented. Rejection rates varied significantly by province and by respondent type (i.e. a respondent who volunteered versus someone who didnâ€™t volunteer). This further compounds the fact that the unweighted sample will not be representative of the target population.

13. Link to documentation and any additional sources used 
-Documents from zip file found at https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/45-25-0001/cat5/c33_2018.zip
